In order to run the notebook, we need to download the API authentication key (private to every user) from Kaggle and upload it to our notebook. The steps to do this are available [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api) under the authentication section. 

Additionally, we need to have PyTorch and OpenCV installed. The commands for these are as follows:
!pip install opencv
!pip install torch
!pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio

For real-time use the following command:
python "Real Time.py"
